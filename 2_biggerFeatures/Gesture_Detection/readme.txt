1. create a interface: SwipeActions
	> 1_SwipeActionsInterface.java

2. create a class: SwipeGestureDetector
	> 2_SwipeGestureDetecorClass.java

3. Set an onTouch-Listener
	> 3_MainActivity.java


Note:
If it doesn't work, check in the logs if the "ACTION_DOWN" is consumed by an other onClickListener
